#   the print() funtion will return whatever is in the parentheses
#   the quotation marks identify a string

print("hello world!")

#   don't forget to close out the quotation marks or parentheses, otherwise a syntax error
#   you can always copy and paste the error message into Google to usually pull up StackOverFlow

####   CODING CHALLENGE #1  ####
print('what to print')

#   this should print the string "what to print"

print("print('what to print')")

#   if you are using quotes within quotes then use double quotes on the outside AND single quotes on the bottom 








####    STRING MANIPULATION ####
#   to write on a new line within a string when printing, use \n

print("Hello world\nHello world\nHello world\nHello world")

#   this saves lines

#   we can also concatenate strings together 

print("Hello" + " " + "Alex Elfering")

#   spaces matter when using python! Mind indentation errors

####    CODING CHALLENGE 2  ####

#   How to debug each line

print(Day - 1 String Manipulation")
#   quotation marks are missing at the beginning of the string
#   solution:
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")

print("String concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
#   this is correct, but I think they want to include the plus sign
#   solution:
print("String concatenation is done with the + sign.")

    print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
#   indentation error
#   solution
print("e.g. print('Hello ' + 'world')")    

print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
#   too many parentheses on the left-hand side
#   solution:
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
