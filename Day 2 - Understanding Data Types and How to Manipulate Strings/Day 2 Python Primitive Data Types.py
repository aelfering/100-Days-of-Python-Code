#   the len() function calculates the length of a string 
#   BUT if you use numbers then the script will break

#   data types!!!!

#   String: a string of characters (lol)

"Hello!"

print("Hello"[0])
print("Hello"[1])
print("Hello"[2])
print("Hello"[4])

#   this prints the first character of the string
#   also known as a subscript
#   counting in Python starts at 0 bc binaries 
#   ALSO NOTE THAT SPACES MATTER


"123"

#   when integers are surrounded by quotes, then it is a string

print("123" + "456")

#   this concatenates the two strings together





#   there is an integer (number with NO decimals)

123

print(123 + 456)


#   you can also use underscores to replace commas in large numbers

123_456_789

#   is the same as

123456789



#   there is a float (numbers with decimals)

3.1456789








#   Lastly there is a boolean 

True
False

#   the first letter is always capitalized and has no quotes around it
